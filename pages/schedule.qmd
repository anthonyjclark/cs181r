Other thoughts

- gaussian equation widget (adjust values and show the graph)
- Maximum Likelihood, Least Squares Estimation, Maximum A Posteriori Estimation
- Least Squares and KKT conditions
- Dual problems: control and estimation
- Least squares as a special case of maximum likelihood estimation on Gaussian models.
- estimation before localization
- if covering linearization, then look at boyds lecture on nonlinear least squares
- boyd lectures have good info on nonlinear control (e.g., directing a nonholonomic robot)
- cirlces and lines path planning (modern robotics)
- Klančar examples (e.g., Kalman)
- Boyd LQR notes
- only teach dynamics when needed; kinematics probably good enough
- reactive, FSMs, hierarchical FSMs, behavior trees, mission planning
- qaudrature encoders
