# Development with Arduino

You will work on exercises in class. Though, you are also welcome to work on them outside of class time if needed. Please do not submit the exercise until you have completed all parts. This will take two class periods to complete.

Do not work too far ahead. I would rather everyone wait until Thursday to start on the second part of the exercise.

## Tuesday: Arduino Setup

Were you able to get the `BlinkWithoutDelay` example working?

(x) Yes
( ) No

## Thursday: Arduino Heartbeat

Before you begin writing code, you must first draw a diagram showing how your code works.

Upload your diagram.

Next, you should turn your diagram into pseudocode. Paste your pseudocode below.

Finally, you will write your code for implementing the heartbeat. Paste your code below.

## Parts Checklist

Please make sure you have all of your parts and that they are in working order before submitting. You will need to complete this checklist every week, and in later weeks the number of items will increase.

If any of your parts are broken or missing, please indicate so below (**by not clicking the checkbox**) and send me a message on slack.
