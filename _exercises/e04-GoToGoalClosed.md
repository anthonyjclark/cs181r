# Go To Goal (Closed-Loop)

You will work on exercises in class. Though, you are also welcome to work on them outside of class time if needed. Please do not submit the exercise until you have completed all parts. This will take two class periods to complete.

Do not work too far ahead. I would rather everyone wait until Thursday to start on the second part of the exercise.
