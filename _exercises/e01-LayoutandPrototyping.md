# Layout and Prototyping

You will work on exercises in class. Though, you are also welcome to work on them outside of class time if needed. Please do not submit the exercise until you have completed all parts. This will take two class periods to complete.

Do not work too far ahead. I would rather everyone wait until Thursday to start on the second part of the exercise.

## Layout and Prototype

For each component consider the following:

- How will it attach to the chassis?
- Where will the wires and cables route?
- Will anything interfere with the cables?
- Can you easily access all switches and buttons?
- How far away are the parts that it connects to?
- How stable is the robot?

Have another group review your layout. List their names here.
