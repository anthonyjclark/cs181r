title: "Pose Estimation"
---

In this chapter we will explore the concept of pose estimation. We'll answer the question: "where is my robot in reference to the origin?" This is a fundamental question in robotics, and we'll explore the math and algorithms that help us answer it.

## What you will learn

- About the concept of pose estimation
- How to use odometry to estimate the pose of a robot
- How to use kinematic and dynamic models to estimate the pose of a robot

## Terminology

odometry
: The use of data from sensors to estimate the position and orientation of a robot

pose estimation
: The process of determining the position and orientation of a robot

locomotion
: The process of moving from one place to another

kinematic model
: A model that describes the motion of a robot based on its geometry and constraints

dynamic model
: A model that describes the motion of a robot based on its geometry, constraints, and forces

motion constraint
: A constraint that limits the motion of a robot

## Exercise

Check gradescope.

You will submit your responses on gradescope. **Only one partner should submit.** The submitter will add the other partner through the gradescope interface.

Additional details for using gradescope can be found here:

- [Submitting an Assignment](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work)
- [Adding Group Members](https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members)
- [gradescope Student Help Center](https://help.gradescope.com/category/cyk4ij2dwi-student-workflow)

You should open the gradescope assignment now so that you know what to work complete.

### Grading

I will grade all exercises using a scale of "Nailed It" / "Not Yet". See the course [grading policy](../index.qmd#grading) for more information, and check gradescope for deadlines.

### Overview

For this exercise, I want you to derive the robot's motion equations. Consider the following diagram for our WMR.

![WMR pose](../_static/images/13-PoseEstimation/WMRPose.svg)

It depicts the global frame $\{G\}$ and the robot frame $\{R\}$. The robot has two wheels, each with a radius $r$, separated by a distance $d$. The robot's pose is defined by its position $({}^Gx, {}^Gy)$ and orientation $\theta$.

Your task is to develop equations that describe the robot's motion. That is, given the robot's wheel velocities $\dot{\phi}_R$ and $\dot{\phi}_L$, determine the robot's linear and angular velocities ${}^G\dot{x}$, ${}^G\dot{y}$, and $\dot{\theta}$.

## Wrap-Up

In the next chapter, we will use these equations to develop a forward kinematics model for our robot.
