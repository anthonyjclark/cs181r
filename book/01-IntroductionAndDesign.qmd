![CAD model for my simple prototype.](/images/CADPrototype.png){width=80% #fig-CADPrototype}

This course is a bit of an experiment. We have a lot of ground I would like to cover, but I also want to give you all the opportunity to "discover" solutions to the problems we face (instead of me lecturing "at" you).

One shortcut I've taken is to choose our task and platform (see @fig-CADPrototype). Specifically, we will focus on wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) and the topics most relevant to computer science students. Even still, we will only cover a small fraction of the possible material. My hope is that you will also learn concepts you can apply outside of robotics. For example, control theory and linear systems are used in many fields, including chemistry, economics, and biology.

Robotics is a large field comprising material from electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering, as well as computer science, sociology, ethics, biology, law, and more. We'll focus on the computer engineering view of robotics: a bit of electronics and a good amount of programming.

Each chapter in this book will roughly follow the outline below (learning goals, terminology, lecture, interactive, exercise, and a list of resources). The exercises will be completed in class, but you are can continue working on them outside of class when needed.

In this first chapter, we will discuss design and you'll start designing and building your course robot.

## What you will learn

- How to define requirements for a robot
- How to select mechanical and electrical parts for a robot
- Basic robot design using computer aided design (CAD) software

## Terminology

robot
: a machine capable of performing actions in response to its sensed environment

requirements
: a set of expected characteristics and abilities for a system

CAD (computer aided design)
: using software to design mechanical parts

## Lecture

This first chapter is lighter than subsequent ones. The first class period will be fairly traditional: I'll present the lecture during class.



TODO: add link to slides
TODO: maybe use https://github.com/jmgirard/embedpdf

## Interactive

Here is a 3D model of our robot:

```{=html}
<script type="module" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/model-viewer/3.5.0/model-viewer.min.js"></script>

<model-viewer style="height: 50vh; width: 100%;" alt="3D CAD model of my wheeled mobile robot." src="../_static/models/WMR.glb" ar camera-controls touch-action="pan-y"></model-viewer>
```

I created this model using [Onshape for Education](https://www.onshape.com/en/education/) (free). You will **not** be required to design and fabricate your own chassis for this course, but I highly recommend doing so. Learning CAD, 3D printing, and laser cutting will open up many possibilities for you in the future.

## Exercise

We have two exercises for this class period:

1. A short introduction quiz on [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/).
2. Building our simple robot. We'll discuss this in class.
