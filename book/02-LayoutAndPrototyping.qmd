title: "Layout and Prototyping"
---

Now that you have the basic layout of your robot, it is time to start assembling and adding parts.

## What you will learn

- How to build a prototype out of cheap materials

## Terminology

prototype:
: A first or preliminary version of a device or vehicle from which other forms are developed.

## Lecture

The videos for this lecture will focus on getting you comfortable with your electronic components.

### Component Layout

Your first prototype will use:

- cardboard
- sticky dots
- hot glue
- velcro
- nylon fasteners

This video covers the layout of your components and shows assembly of a bit more robust prototype.

## Exercise

We will continue from [the previous lecture](./01-IntroductionAndDesign.qmd#exercise) and add electronics and other hardware to the prototype.

### Grading

I will grade all exercises using a scale of "Nailed It" / "Not Yet". See the course [grading policy](../index.qmd#grading) for more information, and check gradescope for deadlines.

## Wrap-Up

This week you learned how to prototype a robot physical design using cheap materials.
