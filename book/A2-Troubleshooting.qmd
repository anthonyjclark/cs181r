## No serial data received

If you see an output like the following:

```text
Connecting......................................

A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: No serial data received.

Error: exit status 1
```

It likely means `jag` is trying to use the wrong port. Try listing the available ports with the following command:

```bash
jag port --list
```

And add the correct port to whatever command you are trying to run. For example:

```bash
jag flash --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem14401
```
