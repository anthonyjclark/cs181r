## Exercise

Intro...

You will submit your responses on gradescope. **Only one partner should submit.** The submitter will add the other partner through the gradescope interface.

Additional details for using gradescope can be found here:

- [Submitting an Assignment](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work)

You should open the gradescope assignment now so that you know what to work complete.

### Grading

I will grade all exercises using a scale of "Nailed It" / "Not Yet". See the course [grading policy](../index.qmd#grading) for more information, and check gradescope for deadlines.
