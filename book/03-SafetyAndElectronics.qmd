Now that you have the basic layout of your robot, it is time to start assembling and adding parts. In this chapter we'll focus on safety and wiring.

## What you will learn

- How to safely work with electronics and Li-Ion batteries
- How to read and understand component specifications
- How to wire and review wiring diagrams

## Terminology

breakout board
: a printed circuit board (PCB) board that makes a chip easier to use when prototyping

microcontroller
: a small computer on a single integrated circuit that contains a processor, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals

specifications
: a detailed description of the design and properties of a component

li-ion battery
: a type of rechargeable battery that is commonly used in consumer electronics

## Exercise

In this week's exercise, you will add components to your cardboard prototype, wire them up, and then write your first programs.

You will submit your responses on gradescope. **Only one partner should submit.** The submitter will add the other partner through the gradescope interface.

Additional details for using gradescope can be found here:

- [Submitting an Assignment](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work)
- [Adding Group Members](https://help.gradescope.com/article/m5qz2xsnjy-student-add-group-members)
- [gradescope Student Help Center](https://help.gradescope.com/category/cyk4ij2dwi-student-workflow)

You should open the gradescope assignment now so that you know what to work complete.

### Grading

I will grade all exercises using a scale of "Nailed It" / "Not Yet". See the course [grading policy](../index.qmd#grading) for more information, and check gradescope for deadlines.

### Overview

This exercise entails:

1. (today) wiring up your robot, and
2. (Thursday) programming your robot to move.

You'll first need to review the safety tips below.

### Some Safety Tips to Review

#### Battery Safety

- Charging and discharging
  - Never completely discharge batteries (3.2V for this class)
  - Charge batteries fully before first use (4.2V)
  - Never charge batteries to more than their full charge voltage (4.2V)
  - Do not charge unattended or leave in the charger unattended
  - Only charge li-ion batteries with a li-ion charger
  - Only charge protected batteries with a charger rated with that ability
  - Always charge batteries on and within fireproof materials
  - Do not use any rechargeable battery or charger with visible damage

- Storing and transporting
  - Do not store li-ion batteries fully charged for an extended period (i.e., weeks)
  - Store batteries at 60-70% rated capacity (around 3.5 to 3.8V)
  - Store and transport batteries in a packed, non-conductive, and safe container
  - Store batteries in a case or individual box in a cool and dry place

- General
  - Never short-circuit a battery
  - Never insert a battery in reverse direction
  - Do not expose batteries to heat
  - Do not connect the positive contact to the negative contact without an appropriate load
  - Never exceed the battery's specifications
  - Properly dispose of all battery cells and chargers in accordance with local laws and mandates
  - If a rechargeable battery overheats, hisses, or bulges, immediately quarantine the battery from any combustible materials - ideally, take the battery outside
  - If a rechargeable battery catches fire, the FAA recommends pouring water or soda on the battery and surrounding areas - ideally, use a foam extinguisher to quell the fire
  - Use an ABC fire extinguisher

#### Electronics Safety

- General
  - Always check for loose wires and debris before powering your circuit
  - Be careful with static electricity (you can accidentally fry a component)
  - Keep consistent wiring colors (eg, red for power, black for ground, white for SDA)
  - Connect and test each component in isolation before combining everything
  - Always put moving parts on “blocks”
  - Always connect ground before power
  - Keep a clean workspace (throw away small bits of wire, insulation, etc.)
  - Always keep an eye on other classmates when your robot is driving autonomously
  - Always use appropriate gauge wires for power requirements
  - Hand calculate current through all components and check against datasheets (same for heat)
  - Know where to find the fire extinguisher

- Power
  - Never touch the circuit board when it is connected to power
  - Always disconnect power before changing connections
  - Keep an eye on your battery's voltage level
  - Never touch a capacitor (even after power is disconnected)

- Heat
  - Keep an eye on the heat being generated by your components
  - The motor driver can get HOT; use caution when positioning and touching

- Ratings
  - Always check a specifications spreadsheet before connecting two components
  - Check for matching voltages, currents, etc. before buying components
  - Make sure you have the correct polarity for all connections
  - Know current limits of I/O ports

- Software
  - Use a heartbeat (deadperson's switch)
  - Always have a way to stop the robot (eg, a kill switch)
  - Include a `halt` function in your code to reset all state
  - Kill power to actuators when programming
