online calculator?
- numbat (no vectors or matrices; i want to add)
  - Point vs Vector physical dimensions
  - https://github.com/sharkdp/numbat/issues/19
  - add vectors and matrices? (and points?) (built into nalgebra)
  - add uncertainty?
  1. come up with example use case (klancar?)
  2. look at matlab/pydy/etc.? for functions
  3. show what would need to be added
  - types: vectors, matrices, etc.
  - dimensions: power? inertia? etc.
  * complex? rational?
  * c<1 + 2i>, r<1 // 2>, e<1 ¬± 2>
  * (1 + 2i), (1 // 2), (1 ¬± 2); (1 + 0i); (a + bi?)
  * ii -> ùëñ
  * anchored negative lookahead: `^(?!$)(?:(\d+)d)?(?:(\d+)h)?(?:(\d+)m)?$`
  * how to embed in website and get output?
